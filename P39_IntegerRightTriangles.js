/* QUESTION: If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

ANSWER: 840 (~0.6s)
*/

let possiblePerimeters = [];

/*We get a < 500 because:
a + b < c
Adding 'c' to both sides,
a + b + c < 2c
Since a + b + c <= 1000,
2c <= 1000 or c <= 500
Since c is the longest side, a < c.
Thus, a < 500

And we get value of 'p' (inside 2nd loop) by solving p = a + b + c and a^2 + b^2 = c^2 and then solving the quadratic equation thus obtained.
