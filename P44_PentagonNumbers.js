/* QUESTION: Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, Pn=n(3n−1)/2. The first ten pentagonal numbers are:

1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...

It can be seen that P4 + P7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P8. However, their difference, 70 − 22 = 48, is not pentagonal.

Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, Pj and Pk, for which their sum and difference are pentagonal and D = |Pk − Pj| is minimised; what is the value of D?

let p = [];
for (let n = 0; true; n++) {
    p[n] = (n + 1) * (3 * (n + 1) - 1) / 2;
    let m;
    for (m = 0; m < n; m++) {
        let sum = p[n] + p[m];
        let dif = p[n] - p[m];
        if (isPentagonal(sum) && isPentagonal(dif)) {
            console.log(dif);
            break;
        }
    }
    if (n - m > 1) {
        break;
    }
}

function isPentagonal(x) {
    let n = (1 + Math.sqrt(1 + 24 * x)) / 6; //solving for n in the pentagonal formula
    return Math.round(n) == n;
}
